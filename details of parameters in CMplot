  \item{Pmap}{
a dataframe, at least four columns. The first column is the name of SNP, the second column is the chromosome of SNP, the third column is the position of SNP, and the remaining columns are the P-value of each trait(Note:each trait a column).
}
  \item{col}{
a vector or a matrix, if "col" equals to a vector, each circle use the same colors, it means that the same chromosome is drewed in the same color, the colors are not fixed, one, two, three or more colors can be used, if the length of the "col" is shorter than the length the chromosome, then colors will be applied circularly. 
if "col" equals to a matrix, the row is the number of circles(traits), the columns are the colors that users want to use for different circles, so each circle can be plotted in different number of colors, the missing value can be replaced by NA. For example: 
col=matrix(c("grey30","grey60",NA,"red","blue","green","orange",NA,NA),3,3,byrow=T).
}

}
  \item{plot.type}{
a character or vector, only "c", "m", "q" or "b" can be used. if plot.type="c", only circle-Manhattan plot will be plotted; if plot.type="m",only Manhattan plot will be plotted; if plot.type="q",only Q-Q plot will be plotted;if plot.type="b", both circle-Manhattan, Manhattan and Q-Q plots will be plotted; if plot.type=c("m","q"), Both Manhattan and Q-Q plots will be plotted.

}
  \item{r}{
a number, the radius for the circle(the inside radius), the default is 1.
}
  \item{xlab}{
a character, the labels for x axis.
}
  \item{ylab}{
a character, the labels for y axis.
}
  \item{xaxs}{
a character, The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the x-axis. Possible values are "r", "i", "e", "s", "d". The styles are generally controlled by the range of data or xlim, if given.
}
  \item{yxas}{
a character, The style of axis interval calculation to be used for the y-axis. See xaxs above..
}
  \item{outward}{
logical, if outward=TRUE,then all points will be plotted from inside to outside.
}
  \item{threshold}{
a number or vector, users can adjust the significant level they want, more than one significant line can be added on the plots, if threshold=0 or NULL, then the threshold line will not be added, the default is 0.01.
